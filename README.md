### Large Scale Web Application with Microservices ###
Implement a 3-tier application utilizing Python Django for the webapp, Java Spring Boot for the RESTful service, PostgreSQL and Cassandra for the database, ReactJS for the SPA.

Containerization is achieved through Docker containers and Docker Compose, with service discovery handled by Netflix Eureka and a gateway provided by Netflix Zuul.

Client-side load balancing is managed using Ribbon, while server-side load balancing is facilitated by Nginx.

Logging is handled by Elasticsearch, Fluent, and Kibana, with tracing supported by Jaeger, and monitoring and alerts provided by Prometheus.

Caching is managed using Redis, RabbitMQ facilitates asynchronous processing, and Cassandra handles horizontal data partitioning.

Deployment is on Kubernetes on GCP, enabling auto-scaling, high availability, and rolling upgrades.
